## Process
1. Helios gathers data on the user through conducting a thorough analysis of their resume, collecting keywords, relevant skills, and any other pertinent data needed to optimize connections.
2. Keywords are sifted through a database containing information from employersâ€™ job descriptions on major hiring sites such as Indeed and Monster, in order to match potential employees to their potential employers.</p>
3. Based on the analyzed data, relevant job listing will appear for potential employees to make use of as they see fit. They will be able to select interesting jobs from Helios and be directed straight to the link of the job itself.</p>
